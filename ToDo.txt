11/15:

DONE Create CSV file input for Medication (Andreas)
DONE Create CSV file input for Order's DONE (Andreas)

DONE Create csv file initialization in Main.java  (Peyton) *In Inventory Class 

Inventory class operations (Andreas)

DONE Start on TransactionLogger class   (Peyton)

Plan out report formatting (nothing fancy, just ASCII type formatting) (Rafael)

New:
  DONE Inventory exported to csv file at end of every day and named based on date
  EndOfDay Script (Logan)
  DONE Include price related things in Order.java and Orders.csv
  DONE? Implement Transaction Logging that includes price of orders, and 
      prepare functions for sales being made in Main.java to customers(Peyton)
  DONE Implement an expiration report. -- Neccessary for a requirement, only run EndOfDay, and only needs to include
      orders expiring in the next 30 days and orders that expire the next day. 
  Does arraylist of orders need to have orders modified every time sales are made?
      i.e. sort by exp date. remove quantity of order after sale. remove order from Inventory if empty...

   Update input csv files to be larger, and possibly remove duplicate medication names
   Implement password for manual restock, and manual report generation
  
  Main Loop Stuff (based on tests?):
    "Sell to Customer" option: medName, price, etc
    "Search For Medication Information" option with input medicationName for viewing medication info about 1 med.
    "Reorder Stock" all fields necessary in Orders.csv (Peyton)
       (Expiration date should be 30 days and batchNumber should be auto generated) 
    "Generate Report" -- followed by select report type -- Maybe can leave out unless manual reports required
